# Search Engine Algorithm Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for our advanced search engine algorithm! This guide will walk you through the key components of our algorithm, how it works, and the ranking formulas employed to deliver relevant search results.

## Algorithm Overview

Our search engine algorithm is designed to efficiently retrieve and rank documents based on their relevance to a user's query. It incorporates several key components to achieve this goal, including:

1. **Web Crawling**: The algorithm crawls the web to gather documents and extract relevant information such as text content, links, and metadata.

2. **Indexing**: Documents are indexed to facilitate fast and accurate retrieval. We use an inverted index data structure to map terms to the documents that contain them.

3. **Query Processing**: When a user submits a search query, the algorithm processes the query to identify relevant terms and expand them using synonyms.

4. **Ranking**: Documents are ranked based on their relevance to the query. This involves calculating a combined score using both content-based metrics (e.g., BM25/BM25+ scores) and link-based metrics (e.g., PageRank scores).

5. **User Interface**: The search results are presented to the user through a user-friendly interface, allowing for easy navigation and exploration of relevant documents.

## Ranking Formulas

### BM25/BM25+ Formula

The BM25 (Best Matching 25) algorithm is used to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It calculates a score based on factors such as term frequency, document length, and inverse document frequency. The formula for BM25 is as follows:

\[ \text{BM25 Score} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{IDF}(q_i) \cdot \frac{f(q_i, D) \cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \cdot (1 - b + b \cdot \frac{\text{doc\_length}}{\text{avg\_doc\_length}})} \]

We also employ an enhanced version called BM25+, which introduces slight modifications to the original formula to improve performance.

### PageRank Formula

The PageRank algorithm is used to rank web pages based on their importance within a hyperlinked set of documents. It assigns a numerical weight to each page, taking into account both the quantity and quality of links pointing to it. The formula for PageRank is as follows:

\[ PR(A) = (1 - d) + d \times \sum_{i} \frac{PR(i)}{C(i)} \]

Where:
- \( PR(A) \) is the PageRank score of page A.
- \( d \) is the damping factor, typically set to 0.85.
- \( PR(i) \) is the PageRank score of page i, which links to page A.
- \( C(i) \) is the number of outbound links from page i.

## Conclusion

Our search engine algorithm combines advanced techniques from information retrieval and web analysis to deliver highly relevant search results to users. By incorporating both content-based and link-based metrics, we strive to provide a comprehensive and effective search experience.
